# Cross-Validation Assessment Report: Qualitative Requirements

**Title**: Cross-Validation of Qualitative Requirements (b) Against Wiki Documentation  
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-12 11:25:00  
**Commit SHA**: 7f92c3ac75a3029ed834d2dc331138aa17dbada0  
**Scope**: qualitative-requirements  

## Document Inventory

**Input Documents** (resolved paths):
- `temp/filestoassess/Qualitative Requirements (b) - Suitability of Proposed Solution and Services.pdf`

**Wiki Corpus**: All MD pages in ../NumbatWallet.wiki/ (32 files auto-discovered)

## Executive Summary

**Totals**:
- Total Requirements Extracted: 45
- Exact Matches: 12 (26.7%)
- Close Matches: 18 (40.0%)
- Missing in Wiki: 8 (17.8%)
- Conflicts: 7 (15.5%)
- Overall Risk: **MEDIUM**

The Wiki documentation is generally well-aligned with PDF requirements, with most critical elements matching. Key gaps exist in specific timing requirements, user counts for pilot phases, and some detailed operational metrics.

## 1) Key Findings

• **POA/PoO Structure**: 5-week duration exactly matches between PDF and Wiki, with consistent week-by-week breakdown
• **Pilot Phases**: 12-month duration and 4-stage structure align, but Wiki lacks specific user counts (50 government, 200+ citizens)
• **Pricing Model**: Base platform fee ($1,375,524), credential tiers, and enterprise discounts match exactly
• **Security Incident Reporting**: Critical conflict - PDF requires 24-hour formal report vs Wiki's 5-business-day PIR
• **ISO Compliance**: ISO 22301 (Business Continuity) mentioned in PDF but missing from Wiki compliance matrix
• **Billing Accuracy**: PDF guarantees 99.9% accuracy with service credits, not documented in Wiki
• **Monthly Reporting**: PDF specifies 5-business-day delivery deadline, Wiki silent on timing
• **Training Timeline**: Both require delivery ≥4 weeks before Pilot commencement
• **Data Retention**: 7-year audit retention period matches exactly
• **CPI Adjustments**: 3% annual cap matches in both sources

## 4) Minimal Diffs (per conflict)

### Security Incident Reporting Timeline
```diff
- Input: "Department notified immediately, formal report within 24 hours"
+ Wiki:  "30 minutes notification + 5 business days formal report"
? Impact: Legal compliance, incident response procedures, team readiness
```

### Pilot User Counts
```diff
- Input: "Stage 2: ~50 government testers, Stage 3: 200+ testers"
+ Wiki:  "Stage 2: Government users, Stage 3: Controlled citizens"
? Impact: Resource planning, infrastructure sizing, success metrics
```

### Monthly Reporting Deadline
```diff
- Input: "Monthly reports within 5 business days of month-end"
+ Wiki:  "Monthly reports delivered"
? Impact: SLA commitments, operational scheduling, penalties
```

### ISO 22301 Certification
```diff
- Input: "ISO 22301 - Business Continuity Management required"
+ Wiki:  [Not mentioned in compliance requirements]
? Impact: Certification costs, BC planning effort, audit scope
```

### Billing Accuracy Guarantee
```diff
- Input: "99.9% billing accuracy guaranteed with service credits"
+ Wiki:  [No billing accuracy SLA specified]
? Impact: Financial risk, credit calculations, dispute process
```

## 5) Assumptions & Open Questions

### Blocking Issues
1. **Security Incident Timeline Conflict**: Which timeline is authoritative - 24 hours (PDF) or 5 days (Wiki)? ⚠️ **BLOCKING**
2. **ISO 22301 Requirement**: Is Business Continuity certification mandatory for contract award? ⚠️ **BLOCKING**

### Non-Blocking Issues
1. **Pilot User Numbers**: Are 50/200+ targets firm requirements or guidance?
2. **Biometric Module Pricing**: Is $244,000 fixed or negotiable based on scope?
3. **Monthly Report Format**: What specific format/structure is required for consumption reports?
4. **Billing Dispute Process**: What is the escalation path for billing accuracy issues?
5. **Training Audience Size**: Expected number of trainees per category?

## 6) Next Actions

1. **Update Support-Model.md**: Align incident reporting timeline to 24-hour requirement
2. **Update Testing-Strategy.md**: Add specific user counts for pilot stages (50 govt, 200+ citizens)
3. **Update Pricing-Assumptions.md**: Add monthly report delivery SLA (5 business days)
4. **Update Compliance-Matrix.md**: Add ISO 22301 certification requirement
5. **Update Support-Model.md**: Document 99.9% billing accuracy guarantee with credit terms
6. **Update Pricing-Assumptions.md**: Add biometric module pricing ($244,000 setup)
7. **Review Home.md**: Verify all high-level requirements reflect PDF updates
8. **Create Risk-Matrix.md entry**: Document ISO 22301 certification timeline risk
