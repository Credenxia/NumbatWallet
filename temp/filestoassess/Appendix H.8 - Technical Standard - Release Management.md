# Appendix H.8 - Technical Standard - Release Management

# Technical Standard PRM Release Management
**Requirement**

**PRM-1:** Supplier must provide an approach to onboarding customers, configuring platforms for their requirements and achieving production readiness.
**Classification:** Must
**Reference Standards:** ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 27001

**Implementation by CredEntry**

CredEntry follows a structured **Release and Onboarding Management Process** aligned to ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management). This ensures every customer is onboarded in a controlled, secure, and repeatable manner, with clear milestones for achieving production readiness.

**1. Onboarding Preparation**

- Establish customer requirements and objectives through discovery workshops.
- Confirm compliance obligations (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001 controls, WA Government policies).
- Allocate dedicated onboarding team (project manager, solution architect, security lead).
- Define scope, timelines, and acceptance criteria in a formal onboarding plan.
**2. Environment Provisioning**

- Deploy segregated environments (Development, Staging, Production) within **Azure Australia East/Central**.
- Apply baseline security controls, including encryption, access management, monitoring, and logging.
- Configure logical multi-tenancy and PKI/identity partitions to align with customer requirements.
**3. Platform Configuration**

- Customise identity providers, PKI, credential schemas, and branding per customer specifications.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and segregation of duties.
- Integrate with customer systems (HR, CRMs, or registries) using APIs or secure connectors.
- Validate configuration against **CredEntry standard configuration checklists**.
**4. Testing and Validation**

- Conduct functional testing (credential issuance, revocation, wallet integration).
- Perform security validation (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).
- Execute conformance testing against **ISO/IEC 18013, ISO/IEC 23220, ****eIDAS**** 2.0** where applicable.
- Document results and remediate any issues before go-live.
**5. Training and Knowledge Transfer**

- Provide administrator and end-user training sessions.
- Deliver tailored operational guides and runbooks.
- Ensure customer security and compliance teams are trained in incident response and reporting workflows.
**6. Go-Live and Production Readiness**

- Conduct **Go-Live Readiness Review** with customer stakeholders.
- Validate data migration, cutover, and rollback procedures.
- Approve production release through **change management board**.
- Transition into steady-state operations under agreed SLAs.
**7. Post-Go-Live Support and Continuous Improvement**

- Monitor system stability and performance during hypercare period (typically first 4â€“6 weeks).
- Capture lessons learned and incorporate into continuous improvement cycle.
- Provide ongoing patching, vulnerability remediation, and feature upgrades under the **CredEntry Release Schedule**.
- Ensure compliance and certification renewals remain current throughout the contract.
