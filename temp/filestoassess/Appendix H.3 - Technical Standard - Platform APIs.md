# Appendix H.3 - Technical Standard - Platform APIs

API Requirements and Implementation

# PA-1: OpenAPI Documentation and Input Validation
- **Requirement**: APIs must be documented via the OpenAPI specification and ensure inputs are validated and privileged access protected.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- All APIs are documented in **OpenAPI**** 3.0 format** with versioned specifications.
- Comprehensive input validation is enforced at both schema and application layers.
- Privileged access is protected using RBAC and OAuth 2.0 with fine-grained scopes.
# PA-2: API Testing and Security Flaws Coverage
- **Requirement**: APIs must be tested for expected behaviour and common API security flaws.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- Automated integration and unit testing covers positive and negative use cases.
- Security testing aligned to **OWASP ASVS** and **OWASP API Security Top 10**.
- Continuous security scanning (SAST/DAST) is built into CI/CD pipelines.
# PA-3: API Segregation and Privilege Separation
- **Requirement**: APIs should be segregated by purpose with strict access controls.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- APIs are grouped into distinct services (issuance, presentation, trust management, revocation).
- Access tokens include scoped permissions per API function.
- Role-based separation ensures only authorised roles can call sensitive endpoints.
# PA-4: Accessible Web Interface for Credential Issuance
- **Requirement**: WCAG 2.2+ compliant web interface for authorised users to issue electronic attribute bundles with pre-populated data.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- Web portal is designed per **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards for accessibility.
- Authorised users can issue credentials manually, via APIs, or via **OIDC claims integration**.
- The interface supports ISO/IEC 18013-7 and OID4VCI issuance workflows.
# PA-5: Support for In-Person and Remote Verification
- **Requirement**: Platform must support in-person (QR code, NFC) and remote (secure link, API call) credential verification.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- SDK and APIs support QR code scanning and NFC-based verification for face-to-face scenarios.
- Remote verification supported via secure links and OIDC4VP-compliant API calls.
- End-to-end cryptographic verification ensures integrity and trustworthiness.
# PA-6: Credential Status Interfaces
- **Requirement**: Verifiers must be able to confirm credential status (active, suspended, revoked).
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- Status check API provides real-time credential status lookups.
- Statuses include: Active, Suspended, Revoked.
- Compliant with **W3C Verifiable Credentials**, **ISO/IEC 18013-5**, and **ISO/IEC 23220-2** standards.
# PA-7: Digital Trust Service Configuration
- **Requirement**: Platform must enable configuration of a digital trust service managing certification material.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- Digital Trust Registry holds Issuers, Wallet Providers, and Verifiersâ€™ public keys and certificates.
- APIs allow filtering and selection by certificate attributes and fingerprints.
- Aligned with **ISO/IEC 18013-5** and **ISO/IEC 23220** for trusted interactions.
# PA-8: Export in Open and Interoperable Formats
- **Requirement**: Platform must enable export of configuration and data in open formats.
- **Implementation by CredEntry**:
- Data exports are provided in **JSON-LD, XML, and CSV** formats, ensuring interoperability.
- All exports cryptographically signed to maintain data integrity.
- Aligned with **WA Cyber Security Policy (2024)** requirements.
# Continuous Improvement and Governance
CredEntry commits to:

- Maintaining OpenAPI documentation in sync with releases.
- Regular penetration testing and conformance testing.
- Ensuring APIs remain interoperable with evolving ISO, W3C, and eIDAS standards.
- Providing developers with sandboxes, example integrations, and transparent changelogs.
