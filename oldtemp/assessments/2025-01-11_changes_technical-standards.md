  ### 1.4 Technical Standards Compliance (CredEntry Implementation)

  #### TS-1: Data Protection Measures
  **Implementation:** All PII and credential data encrypted using AES-256. Keys generated, stored, and rotated within Azure Key Vault HSMs (FIPS 140-3). All data transfers use TLS 1.3 with Perfect Forward Secrecy. SHA-256 hash signatures confirm immutability. Immutable audit logging via Azure Monitor/Sentinel.

  #### TS-2: Secure Communication Channels  
  **Implementation:** APIs exposed exclusively via HTTPS/TLS 1.3. Mutual TLS (mTLS) required for certificate authority operations and key material distribution. Modern cipher suites only (AES-GCM, CHACHA20-POLY1305). Application-layer encryption for biometrics and government identifiers.

  #### TS-3: Multi-Factor Authentication
  **Implementation:** Azure AD Conditional Access enforces MFA for all administrative access. Supported methods: FIDO2/WebAuthn, Microsoft Authenticator, certificate-based authentication. Step-up authentication for key management and issuance. Meets Digital ID Authentication Level 2.

  #### TS-4: Data Minimisation and Purpose Limitation
  **Implementation:** Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) selective disclosure in wallet/verifier protocols. Explicit user consent screens before credential sharing. Purpose-bound API access controls. Role-based least-privilege access.

  #### TS-5: PKI Management  
  **Implementation:** Multi-tenant PKI with Issuer Authority Certificate Authorities (IACAs) per entity isolated in Azure HSMs. Automated certificate lifecycle with CRL/OCSP support. Document Signing Certificates comply with ISO/IEC 18013-5 and 23220.

  #### TS-6: Standardised Data Elements and Offline Presentation
  **Implementation:** Credentials follow ISO/IEC 18013-5 and 23220 schemas. Embedded digital signatures enable offline verification via QR codes or NFC. Selective disclosure preserved in offline mode.

  #### TS-7: Issuance APIs (OID4VCI)
  **Implementation:** All credential issuance follows OID4VCI standard. SDKs provide secure key binding and nonce validation. Formal conformance testing scheduled during Pilot Phase.

  #### TS-8: Presentation APIs (OIDC4VP)
  **Implementation:** Supports end-to-end OIDC4VP credential presentation flows. APIs require mutual authentication and enforce purpose-limited claims. Conformance validation during Pilot Phase.

  #### TS-9: User Transaction Log and Dashboard
  **Implementation:** Comprehensive dashboard showing all credential lifecycle events with timestamps. GDPR-compliant data erasure requests. Suspicious activity reporting with automated alerts. WCAG 2.2+ compliant interface.

  #### TS-10: Digital ID (Accreditation) Rules 2024
  **Implementation:** System policies reflect Chapter 4 requirements. Progressive compliance with full validation during Pilot Phase.

  #### TS-12: Mutable Credential Fields
  **Implementation:** Remote attribute updates supported without full reissuance where feasible. All updates cryptographically signed and audit logged per ISO/IEC 18013-5.

  #### TS-13: Adaptability to Evolving Standards
  **Implementation:** Modular architecture enables independent service updates. Versioned APIs/SDKs with backward compatibility. Standards tracking for ISO/IEC 23220-3/4.

  ### 1.3 Platform Multi-Tenancy Standards (CredEntry)

  #### PM-1: Partitioning into PKI and Identity Containers
  **Implementation:** Logical partitioning into independent PKI and Identity containers per tenant. Each container provides isolated trust boundaries ensuring data and cryptographic material separation. Aligned with eIDAS 2.0 and ISO/IEC 27001/27002.

  #### PM-2: Separate PKI Configuration
  **Implementation:** Each tenant container configures its own PKI including certificate authorities, trust anchors, and cryptographic policies. Independent key lifecycles and governance while maintaining compliance.

  #### PM-3: Separate Identity Provider Configuration  
  **Implementation:** Container-specific IdP configuration supporting unique OIDC/SAML providers per tenant. Logical isolation maintained across all tenants.

  #### PM-4: Container-Specific Branding and Customisation
  **Implementation:** Independent branding, theming, and interface customization at container level. Organisations deliver tailored user experience while maintaining OWASP ASVS compliance.
