Summary
This addendum to Request DPC2142 clarifies several queries regarding a digital wallet and verifiable credentials solution. It addresses concerns about a strict bank guarantee clause, indicating its final inclusion will be decided during negotiations, and allows for proposed departures from the terms. The document also confirms that a supplier's test Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is acceptable for Proof-of-Operation, which is anticipated to commence in late October 2025 with a three-week preparation period. Furthermore, it clarifies that integration with the WA Identity Exchange is primarily for OID4VCI workflows, acting as a federated authentication source for issuers, rather than end-users. Finally, the addendum firmly states that the closing date of 12 September 2025 cannot be extended, emphasising adherence to project timelines.

Addendum Advice
Item 1
Reference Schedule 12 – Approved Form of Bank Guarantee
Query “Unconditionally and irrevocably covenants to pay to the Customer on first demand by the Customer any sum or sums which may from time to time be demanded by the Customer up to an aggregate maximum of [$500,000].”
This wording seems quite strict, and we’re trying to better understand under what scenarios the department would seek to enforce the guarantee and require payment, particularly given that insurance is typically intended to cover such risks. Could you please advise whether there is scope to depart from this requirement, or if compliance with this clause will be mandatory?
Response The inclusion of the Bank Guarantee will be determined with the Preferred Respondent during negotiations.
Respondents can propose departures from the Terms and Conditions in their Response. Refer to section 4(a) of DPC2142 Request – Provision of a Digital Wallet and Verifiable Credentials Solution.
Item 2
Reference Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements - 1.4 Proof-of-Operation
Query Can we confirm if the Supplier PKI can be a test PKI for Proof-of-Operation?
Response It is acceptable for Supplier PKI to be used as test for Proof-of-Operation.
Item 3
Reference Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements - 1.4 Proof-of-Operation
Query Can DPC provide a timeline estimate of when the Proof-of-Operation is likely to start? E.g. 1st of Dec?
Response The Proof-of-Operation is expected to commence in late October. Shortlisted Respondents will be given three weeks from the commencement date to prepare the Proof-of-Operation. A demonstration
Item 3
may be required at the end of the three weeks before the two-week assessment by DGov commences.
Item 4
Reference Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements - 1.5 Pilot Phase - 1.5.1 Key Objectives
Query Can you confirm that “integration with WA Identity exchange” is for the authentication of administrative users from Service WA and issuers, and not for end-users holding wallets.
Response As per the functional requirements, the platform must be configurable to use standalone OIDC or SAML identity providers for credential workflows.
Integration is required from the perspective of supporting OID4VCI workflows as the Identity Exchange sits in the middle of this flow acting as the federated authentication source for issuers.
Item 5
Reference Closing Time: 2:30pm Friday 12 September 2025, Western Australia
Query Can DPC provide a 1-week extension to the closing time/date to Friday September 19th?
Response Due to the project timelines the closing date cannot be extended.
Note: Please see section 1.5.1 Deadline for Questions in DPC2142 Request - Provision of a Digital Wallet and Verifiable Credentials Solution. END ADDENDUM
