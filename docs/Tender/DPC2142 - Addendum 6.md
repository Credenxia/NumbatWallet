Summary
This addendum to Request DPC2142 addresses several queries from potential respondents regarding the technical and financial aspects of a proposed SaaS solution. A key theme is the client's delegation of design responsibility for the SaaS hosting and data isolation to the respondent, expecting them to clearly articulate and cost their proposed solution for shared versus dedicated instances, multi-tenancy, and data separation. While respondents seek guidance on infrastructure sizing, high availability, and disaster recovery during pilot and production phases to manage costs, the client largely refers back to the existing Specification and Statement of Requirements, placing the onus on the respondent to detail their service delivery and align with the specified functionality. The document also clarifies the expectation for the SaaS vendor to provide OpenID4VP backend verification functionality, adhering to the specified workflow.

Addendum Advice
Item 1
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query What scope would you like to see covered by the SaaS hosting fees in the financial response? Are we expected to include the cost of hosting a dedicated instance of the SaaS solution? Or can it be shared with other customers (assuming appropriate logical and physical security and data separation is applied)? If the SaaS solution can be shared with other customers, do you want only the hosting costs attributed to yourselves to be shown in the financial response?
Response SaaS hosting design and associated costs should be defined by the Respondent. Your proposal should clearly articulate your solution and be costed accordingly.
Item 2
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Could you kindly explain what type of multi-tenancy and isolation of data you require for the Issuance Platform? Is logical separation sufficient? Or do you require physical separation with separate infrastructure for each WA end customer? This is important to understand the costs.
Response SaaS hosting design should be defined by the Respondent. Your response should clearly articulate your proposed solution and be costed accordingly.
Item 3
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query In order to help us to prepare the best and most economical hosting costs, can you kindly provide some guidance on how you would like us to size the infrastructure during the Pilot phase? For example, is it okay to assume this will be based on the small-scale deployment model? Is there the need for the high availability of all components? Would it be acceptable for the Pilot preproduction environment to operate as a scaled down version of the production environment without the costs of full redundancy (high availability)? Do the SLA availability requirements apply during the pilot phase? Is there the need for disaster recovery during the pilot phase?
Item 3
Could you kindly provide more information to help ensure all vendor responses are scoped and costed similarly?
Response Service delivery is at the discretion of the Respondent. The staged Pilot should be scalable and able to demonstrate the full functionality of the solution in accordance with the Specification and Statement of Requirements.
Item 4
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Furthermore, could you also confirm whether, during the full Production phase, the Full Pre-production environment may operate as a scaled-down version of the Full Production environment during periods of inactivity?
Response Please refer to the Specification and Statement of Requirements.
Item 5
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Could you kindly confirm how many environments you require for each stage of the project? For example, we understand the pilot phase will run on the preproduction environment. Can we agree to limit it to just this to reduce the hosting costs during the pilot phase? Can you confirm how many environments you are expecting during the pilot and full production phases? Do they have any specific requirements in terms of sizing for the costing exercise?
Response Please refer to the Specification and Statement of Requirements.
Item 6
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query If the infrastructure will be dynamically created or scaled over time, how would you like to scope the hosting costs over time? Can you provide a more detailed production forecast to help us understand how the solution will grow over time?
Response Hosting costs should be prepared in accordance with the Attachment 4 – Schedule 7 Pricing schedule. For details on Full Production please refer to the Specification and Statement of Requirements.
Item 7
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Could you kindly confirm if the SaaS vendor is only expected to provide the Digital Trust Services to support the verifiers? Or should they also provide full OpenID4VP backend verification functionality? We essentially want to understand if the OpenID4VP backend verification functionality will be provided by other third-parties or if the SaaS vendor needs to provide OpenID4VP functionality on the backend that implements the OpenID4VP verification protocol, receives the data from the mobile and exposes it via an APIs to such third-party integrators?
Item 7
Response In accordance with Attachment 3 – Schedule 3 Specifications, requirement TS-8, platform presentation APIs and SDKs must adhere to the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP) workflow.
Item 8
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Is high availability required for the pilot phase?
Response As per the specification and Statement of Requirements, the staged Pilot will be scalable and able to demonstrate the full functionality of the solution.
Item 9
Reference DPC2142 Attachment 2 - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements
Query Shall WA implementation be dedicated to WA or could it be hosted with other customers?
Response Hosting design should align with the Respondent’s proposed solution. The Response should clearly articulate your solution in accordance with the Specification and Statement of Requirement.
