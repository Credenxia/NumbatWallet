2. Selection Process
2.1 Selection Process
Achieve Value for Money is a key Western Australian Procurement Rule. It ensures that when purchasing Goods and/or Services, State Agencies achieve the best possible outcome, for every dollar spent, by assessing the costs and benefits of, and the risks inherent in, an Offer, rather than simply selecting the lowest Offered Price.
In determining value for money, the Customer will:
a). apply relevant Western Australian Procurement Rules and Government policies and priorities, including those referenced in the Western Australian Social Procurement Framework, to the assessment of Offers;
b). assess Offers against the Compliance and Disclosure Requirements in Section 4 in Part B;
c). assess Offers against the Qualitative Requirements in Section 5 in Part B;
d). assess Offers against the Insurance Requirements in Section 6 in Part B; and
e). assess the Offered Prices, which includes assessing the Offered Price and Pricing Requirements in Section 6 in Part B which references Attachment 4 – Schedule 7 Pricing and Payment.
The determination of value for money will require a consideration of all of the above factors and any other matters that the Customer considers relevant.
The evaluation of responses will involve the following stages:
• Qualitative and price evaluation
• Initial shortlisting (if required)
• Secondary shortlisting (if required)
• Proof-of-Operation activity
• Selection of a preferred Respondent
• Contract negotiation.
2.1.1 Selection of Shortlisted Respondent(s)
Initial Shortlisting
One or more Respondents may be shortlisted after the initial assessment in accordance with the points above. The initially shortlisted Respondents may be required to provide a demonstration of their solution. The number of shortlisted Respondents will be determined following the initial assessment. The Department reserves the right to not conduct demonstrations and progress initially shortlisted Respondents directly to the Proof-of-Operation stage.
If requested to participate in the shortlisting process, the Respondent must do so at the location and/or by the method (e.g. a virtual meeting) within the timeframe specified by the Department. The demonstration location/method and timeframe may be altered at the Customer’s discretion. Failure to provide a live demonstration within the required timeframe may result in the Respondent’s offer being eliminated from further consideration.
All costs incurred in relation to the demonstration, including but not limited to preparation, delivery, equipment, personnel, and travel, shall be borne solely by the Respondent.
Secondary Shortlisting
A secondary shortlisting may be conducted following the outcome of the demonstrations. Respondents selected from the secondary shortlisting will be required to conduct a Proof-of-Operation.
The intent of the Proof-of-Operation would be to demonstrate and clarify aspects of the proposed solution through a live, non-production environment based on parameters provided by the Department. The Proof-of-Operation will allow the shortlisted Respondents to demonstrate the capability of their solution and its capacity to integrate with the existing DGov environment and business workflows.
The Proof-of-Operation is expected to require the Respondent to configure an instance of their white-label or proprietary digital wallet environment to demonstrate the parameters of their proposed solution and processes for presentation and consumption of verifiable credentials.
The Proof-of-Operation will be conducted with shortlisted Respondent/s in parallel over a proposed three-week implementation/integration period, followed by up to two weeks of Department testing. All Respondents will be given equivalent time for their implementation and integration work, and the Proof-of-Operation will be completed and evaluated prior to the appointment of a preferred Respondent. The Department reserves the right to amend these proposed timeframes.
Shortlisted Respondents will be required to provide the SDK architecture for review by the Department’s incumbent ServiceWA Development Partner during the Proof-of-Operation.
All costs associated with the conduct, preparation, and delivery of the Proof-of-Operation shall be borne solely by the Respondent including any resources, infrastructure, or personnel required to demonstrate compliance with the specified requirements.
Preferred Respondent
Following the Proof-of-Operation the Evaluation Panel will review the qualitative scoring against the Qualitative Requirements excluding the Participation Plan qualitative requirement of the shortlisted Respondents. The outcome of this review, based on the Proof-of-Operation will determine the recommendation of a preferred Respondent.
The preferred Respondent will be appointed to commence contract negotiations, implementation planning, final solution design and finalisation of pricing, as well as the development of implementation, project and training plans.
Respondents should refer to the Request Conditions for the provisions relating to selection of the preferred Respondent.
