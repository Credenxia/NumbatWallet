While biometrics are not currently in-scope, the document indicates a future interest, with any proposed solutions needing to align with Digital ID 2024 data standards Auth Level 2.

Addendum Advice
Item 1
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements
Query Is it correct to assume the implementation of a citizen digital onboarding solution with integrated Know Your Customer (KYC) functionality is outside the main scope of delivery? Is this an optional element you are interested in understanding more about?
Response Not at this time. KYC is out of scope.
Item 2
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements
Query For the optional biometric matching line item referenced on the financial response, could you kindly provide more information about what is required and how this will be used? It would be really useful to receive further clarification on the expected features, compliance standards, and integration requirements associated with this solution. For example, is there any biometric authentication requirement for 1:1 matching and Liveness detection needed for this optional biometric matching?
Response Biometrics are not currently in-scope; however, we wanted to provision for it for potential future capability. Noting that all financials can be discussed and refined during negotiation activities for the preferred respondent, at this time, please assume biometrics are to align with Digital ID 2024 data standards Auth Level 2.
Item 3
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements
Query We would like to check if DPC would provide the Contractor the secure room to install the Root CA HSM, Root Key Management System and its Infrastructure which is generally a secure PC?
Response DPC will manage the Root CA infrastructure.
