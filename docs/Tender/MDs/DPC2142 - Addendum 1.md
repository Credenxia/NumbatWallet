Summary
This addendum, DPC2142 Addendum No. 1, clarifies crucial requirements for a tender process, primarily focusing on ISO certification expectations. It outlines that while full certification is preferred, it's not always mandatory at the time of offer submission, with demonstrable alignment and a clear timeline for achieving certification often sufficing. The document also sets a firm deadline for full certification to be in place by the end of the Pilot period and specifies that initial evidence can be a detailed self-assessment, though third-party results will be required for full certification. Finally, it provides guidance on maintaining certifications throughout the contract, acknowledging that different ISO standards have varying certification paths and maintenance requirements.

Addendum Advice
Item 1
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements – Section 1.3 Quality Standards
Query For each of the referenced ISO standards, could you explicitly state whether full certification is mandatory prior to contract award, or if demonstrable alignment and a clear timeline for achieving full certification post-award will suffice?
Response Full certification is preferred; however, it is not mandatory for a response. Please refer to the guidelines below for further clarification.
For the management system/process related ISO standards like ISO 9001 and ISO 27001, current certification is preferred as it demonstrates organisation and process maturity.
In cases where certification has not yet been achieved, Respondents are requested to outline their status within the certification process (e.g., gap analysis, implementation, audit, or specific certification stage) and provide a timeline indicating their intent towards full certification.
For interoperability and mobile driver’s licence readiness, full ISO 18013-5 certification is preferred, ideally issued by a recognised body such as UL Solutions. In the absence of full certification, a clear timeline and risk analysis would suffice for the tender response.
Where the ISO standards is more of a technical framework, an internally validated self-assessment is sufficient with accompanying detailed documentation.
Regardless of current certification status, Respondents should provide a clear and detailed explanation of their position and work in progress, or future intentions. All responses will be evaluated on its merits.
Item 2
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements – Section 1.3 Quality Standards
Query If a timeline for achieving full certification is acceptable for certain ISO standards, what are the Department's expectations for this timeline (e.g.,
Item 2
within 6 months, 12 months, etc., of contract commencement) specific to each ISO standard?
Response Given that Pilot activities are anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2026, and any contract extensions (if exercised) would begin in 2027, it is mandatory that the full certification for applicable ISO standards be in place by the end of the Pilot period.
Item 3
Reference Schedule 3 - Specifications
Query Regarding requirements such as "Provide independent test results" or "Provide conformance test results", could you confirm if these refer exclusively to audits and results from accredited third-party organisations, or if internal conformance testing and self-assessments would also be considered as evidence of "progress towards achieving compliance" in the interim?
Response In the first instance (where certification has not been achieved), a detailed self-assessment would suffice. In line with our response to question 1 above, where certification can be attained for a standard, results from a third-party organisation would be required to prove full certification where applicable.
Item 4
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements – Section 1.3 Quality Standards
Query Given the requirement to "maintain" certifications for the duration of the contract for certain standards like ISO/IEC 27001, could you provide guidance on the frequency and type of ongoing evidence (e.g., annual audits, continuous monitoring reports) expected to demonstrate this maintenance?
Response Ideally this would be dictated by the requirement of the applicable standard.
Guidelines as follows:
mDL Standards (18013-5 & 18013-7): While ISO itself does not issue certificates for these, third-party conformity assessments exist for 18013-5. The newer 18013-7 is currently a technical specification and does not yet have formal certification path.
Management System Standards (27001, 9001): These are certifiable via accredited bodies, with well-established audit cycles and maintenance requirements.
Technical Frameworks (23220-1, 12207, 29100): Do not support formal certification, though can self-assess and align their internal procedures accordingly.
Cryptographic Module Standard (19790:2025): Certification isn't ISO-issued but handled through private certification schemes, ensuring ongoing module security validation.
Item 5
Reference Schedule 2 – Specification/Statement of Requirements
Query Would a proposal be accepted if it used existing WA infrastructure and was managed as a managed service instead of SaaS offering?’
Response If a proposal suggested using existing WA infrastructure and was managed as a managed service instead of a SaaS offering it would be considered.
