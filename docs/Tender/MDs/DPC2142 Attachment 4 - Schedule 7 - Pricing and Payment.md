Summary
This document outlines the pricing and payment requirements for a digital wallet and verifiable credentials solution, requested under DPC2142. It presents two primary pricing methodologies for full production: a fixed "Infrastructure + Overheads" model and a "Consumption Based Pricing" model, where costs are tied to usage. Respondents must provide pricing for a Pilot Phase, which will be evaluated and finalised before contract award, and all pricing must include GST and be for a 12-month duration. Additionally, the document requests details for optional biometric integration, along with training, onboarding services, and a rate card for ad hoc work.

Schedule 7 - Pricing and Payment Pricing Submission Overview
Option 1: Infrastructure + Overheads (Full Production)
Respondents may propose a fixed pricing model that includes: · Setup costs, implementation and integration. · A base infrastructure fee covering platform hosting, maintenance, and security. · Operational overheads such as support, monitoring, and reporting. This model should reflect predictable, ongoing costs and may scale based on deployment size or service levels. Pricing should be based on a 12 month duration.
Pilot Pricing
To support flexibility and alignment with varying operational models, Respondents are invited to submit pricing proposals using the following two methodologies in addition to the Pilot Phase pricing schedule. These options are designed to accommodate different approaches to cost recovery and scalability during both the Pilot and Full Production phases. The preferred pricing methodology is Option 1 and Respondents should provide this pricing methodology as a minimum. Pilot pricing and options 1 and 2 will be used for evaluation of the Respondents pricing and final agreed pricing for the Full Production environment will be negotiated using one of these methodologies. All pricing must include GST. All costs must be fully declared in your response. Any costs that are not clearly identified in your response will not be accepted when approving payments under this contract.
Respondents must provide a breakdown of their proposed pricing to deliver the Pilot Phase of the Contract. This pricing will be included for evaluation purposes and will be confirmed and agreed with the preferred Respondent prior to award of the Contract.
Respondents should also include: · A description of any training and onboarding services offered, including format (e.g., virtual, in-person), duration, frequency and cost. · A rate card for ad hoc work, including hourly or daily rates for roles such as technical support, integration, development, or consulting services.
Training and Ad Hoc Services
Option 2: Consumption Based Pricing (Full Production)
Respondents may propose a usage-based model where pricing is determined by: · Setup costs, implementation and integration. · The number of credentials actively managed within the digital wallet ecosystem. · Tiered or per-unit pricing structures are acceptable. This model should align with actual service consumption and user adoption. Respondents are encouraged to provide both options that best reflects their service delivery approach and to clearly outline inclusions, assumptions, and any volume-based thresholds. Pricing should be based on a 12 month duration.
Biometrics Integration
The contractor is requested to provide pricing for the inclusion of biometric capabilities (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint authentication) as an optional enhancement (Optional Module) to the digital wallet solution. Requirements: · Clearly itemise costs associated with biometric feature development, integration, and testing. · Specify any third-party services, SDKs, or licensing fees involved. · Outline any additional security, privacy, or compliance considerations. · Indicate impact on business-as-usual delivery timelines and dependencies. This pricing should be presented independently from the core solution to allow for evaluation and potential inclusion based on budget and strategic priorities.
