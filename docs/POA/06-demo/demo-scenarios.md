A: "Yes, legally recognized under the Electronic Transactions Act. Physical cards remain available as backup."

Q: "How is this different from a PDF?"
A: "Cryptographically secured, can't be forged, selective disclosure, real-time verification, instant revocation."

Q: "What about elderly citizens?"
A: "Physical cards remain available. Family members can assist. Simple interface designed for all ages."

Q: "Is my data sold or tracked?"
A: "No. Complete privacy. Verifiers can't track usage. No commercial use of data. Government privacy laws apply."
```
