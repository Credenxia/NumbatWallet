# POA Issue Dependency Matrix

## Critical Path Issues

These issues block the most other work and should be prioritized:

### Foundation Issues (Must Complete First)
1. **#1** - POA-001: Azure subscription setup â†’ Blocks ALL infrastructure
2. **#10** - POA-012: Backend project structure â†’ Blocks ALL backend work
3. **#62** - POA-100: Wallet app architecture â†’ Blocks ALL wallet features
4. **#72** - POA-110: ISO 18013-5 implementation â†’ Blocks mDL features
5. **#87** - POA-125: IACA root certificates â†’ Blocks ALL PKI work

### Critical Path for Demo (Sequential)
1. Infrastructure Setup (#1)
   â†“
2. Backend Structure (#10)
   â†“
3. Authentication (#13)
   â†“
4. Credential APIs (#17)
   â†“
5. Wallet Architecture (#62)
   â†“
6. Wallet UI Implementation (#64-67)
   â†“
7. Communication Features (#95, #96, #68)
   â†“
8. Demo App Integration (#24)
   â†“
9. Live Demonstration (#19)

## Dependency Categories

### Wallet Dependencies

## Parallel Work Streams

These can be worked on independently:

### Stream 1: Infrastructure
- Azure setup (#1)
- Database (#2)
- Networking (#26)
- Key Vault (#4)
- Container Registry (#3)

### Stream 2: Standards
- ISO 18013-5 (#72)
- W3C VC (#74)
- W3C DID (#75)
- OpenID4VCI (#76)
- OpenID4VP (#77)

### Stream 3: Wallet UI/UX
- Design mockups (#63)
- UI components
- Accessibility
- Localization

### Stream 4: PKI
- IACA setup (#87)
- DSC implementation (#88)
- Trust lists (#89)
- HSM integration (#90)

## Demo Requirements

For successful demo, these must be complete:

### Week 1 Deliverables
- [ ] Infrastructure deployed (#1-9)
- [ ] Backend operational (#10-11)
- [ ] SDKs delivered (#12, #39, #41)

### Week 2 Deliverables
- [ ] Authentication working (#13)
- [ ] Credential APIs (#17)
- [ ] Wallet core features (#62-67)

### Week 3 Demo Requirements
- [ ] Offline verification (#94)
- [ ] QR codes (#95)
- [ ] NFC support (#96)
- [ ] Demo app (#24)
- [ ] Live presentation (#19)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **ServiceWA Integration** - Start early, daily sync
2. **PKI Certificates** - Order immediately
3. **Standards Compliance** - Engage consultant
4. **Device Testing** - Procure devices now
5. **Performance** - Continuous testing

### Contingency Plans
- If wallet delayed â†’ Use white-label solution
- If PKI delayed â†’ Use test certificates
- If standards fail â†’ Document compliance roadmap
- If integration blocked â†’ Mock endpoints
- If performance poor â†’ Reduce concurrent users
