## Critical Path Analysis

### 🚨 Foundation Issues (Must Start Immediately)
These issues block the most work and must be prioritized:

1. **Infrastructure Foundation**
   - #1: Azure subscription setup → Blocks ALL infrastructure
   - #2: PostgreSQL setup → Blocks database work
   - #4: Key Vault → Blocks PKI and secrets

2. **Development Foundation**
   - #10: Backend project structure → Blocks ALL backend
   - #62: Wallet app architecture → Blocks ALL wallet features
   - #63: UI/UX designs → Blocks UI implementation

3. **Standards Foundation**
   - #72: ISO 18013-5 → Blocks mDL features
   - #74: W3C VC → Blocks credentials
   - #76: OpenID4VCI → Blocks issuance

4. **PKI Foundation**
   - #64: IACA root certificates → Blocks ALL PKI
   - #67: HSM integration → Blocks key operations
