# POA Updated Schedule - September 22 Start

**Generated:** September 11, 2025  
**POA Duration:** September 22 - October 31, 2025  
**Total Capacity:** 60 person-days (2 resources × 30 working days)  
**Required Effort:** 72 person-days → 60 with 50% AI efficiency

## Summary of Changes

### Key Updates:
1. ✅ **New Pre-POA milestone created** (000-Pre-POA-Preparation)
2. ✅ **Start date moved to September 22** to provide adequate capacity
3. ✅ **All weekend work eliminated** - dates adjusted to weekdays only
4. ✅ **Resource labels created** (resource-r1, resource-r2, ai-assisted)
5. ✅ **Issues added to project board** for tracking

### Weekend Conflicts Fixed:
- October 4 (Saturday) → October 3 (Friday)
- October 11 (Saturday) → October 10 (Friday)  
- October 18 (Saturday) → October 17 (Friday)
- October 25 (Saturday) → October 24 (Friday)
- November 1 (Saturday) → October 31 (Friday)

## Resource Allocation

### R1 (Architect/Dev):
- Infrastructure setup and configuration
- Authentication and security implementation
- Integration and architecture
- Demo preparation and presentations

### R2 (Developer):
- Backend development and APIs
- SDK implementations (Flutter, .NET, TypeScript)
- Testing framework and test implementation
- Documentation with AI assistance

## Schedule Overview

### Pre-POA Phase (Sept 22-30)
**Week -1.5: Foundation Setup**

- All Bicep templates (AI-generated)

### Official POA Phase (Oct 1-31)

**Week 1 (Oct 1-3): On-site Integration**
- Wednesday: Team arrival, ServiceWA meeting
- Thursday: SDK delivery, integration workshop
- Friday: Deployment and Week 1 checkpoint

**Week 2 (Oct 6-10): Core Development**
- OIDC authentication implementation
- CQRS and credential APIs
- Mock WA IdX integration
- Flutter SDK authentication module

**Week 3 (Oct 13-17): Demo Preparation**
- Demo mobile application
- Security and load testing
- TypeScript SDK completion

**Week 5 (Oct 27-31): Evaluation**
- Handover package creation
- Final presentation preparation
- Contract evaluation (Friday)

## AI Efficiency Strategy

### High AI Impact Areas (50%+ reduction):
1. **Bicep Templates**: 5 days → 2 days
2. **Unit Tests**: 10 days → 5 days
3. **SDK Boilerplate**: 6 days → 3 days
4. **Documentation**: 5 days → 2.5 days
5. **API Scaffolding**: 4 days → 2 days

### Total Savings: 
- Original: 120 person-days
- With AI: 60 person-days (50% reduction)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Aggressive AI adoption** for all boilerplate and repetitive tasks
2. **Parallel execution** wherever dependencies allow
3. **Pre-built templates** ready before Sept 22
4. **Daily coordination** between R1 and R2 resources
5. **Continuous testing** with AI-generated test suites

## Manual Updates Still Required

The following dates need to be manually updated in the GitHub Project view:

| Issue | Current Date | Update To | Description |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| #18 | Oct 11 (Sat) | Oct 10 (Fri) | Flutter SDK auth |
| #19 | Oct 18 (Sat) | Oct 17 (Fri) | Demo presentation |
| #22 | Oct 25 (Sat) | Oct 24 (Fri) | Performance testing |
| #23 | Nov 1 (Sat) | Oct 31 (Fri) | Final presentation |
| #27,30,37,38 | Oct 4 (Sat) | Oct 3 (Fri) | Various Week 1 tasks |
| #41,61 | Oct 18 (Sat) | Oct 17 (Fri) | TypeScript SDK, Coverage |
| #55 | Oct 11 (Sat) | Oct 10 (Fri) | Performance baseline |

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: AI efficiency not achieving 50%
**Mitigation:** Start templates and boilerplate generation immediately

### Risk 2: Integration delays with ServiceWA
**Mitigation:** Mock interfaces ready, parallel development paths

### Risk 3: Resource availability
**Mitigation:** Clear schedule commitment, backup support identified

## Next Actions

1. **Immediately:** Update remaining dates manually in GitHub Project
2. **By Sept 15:** Complete all template preparations
3. **Sept 22:** Both resources begin full-time on POA
4. **Daily:** Monitor progress against this schedule
5. **Weekly:** Adjust priorities based on completion rates

---

This schedule is achievable with disciplined execution, aggressive AI adoption, and the commitment of both resources starting September 22, 2025.
