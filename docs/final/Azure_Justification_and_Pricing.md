## 1. Why Microsoft Azure for WA Government

### 1.1 Azure Extended Zone Coming to Perth (Mid-2025)

**Official Announcement:** December 11, 2024  
**Source:** [Microsoft Australia News Centre](https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2024/12/11/microsoft-extends-azure-cloud-infrastructure-to-western-australia/)

Microsoft has officially announced the deployment of an **Azure Extended Zone to Perth by mid-2025**, perfectly aligning with our Digital Wallet pilot and production timeline. This represents Microsoft's first dedicated cloud infrastructure specifically for Western Australia.

### 1.2 Strategic Advantages for WA Government

| Advantage | Impact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Data remains within WA | Azure Extended Zone in Perth |
| **Low Latency** | <10ms response times | Local infrastructure deployment |
| **Government Partnership** | Existing agreements | WA Gov cloud & cybersecurity deals |
| **Local Support** | Perth-based resources | Microsoft Australia presence |
| **Compliance** | Australian standards | IRAP, Protected certification |
| **AI Services** | Advanced capabilities | Azure OpenAI in AU regions |

### 1.3 WA Government Digital Strategy Alignment

The Azure deployment directly supports:
- **WA Digital Industries Acceleration Strategy** (August 2024)
- **Digital Inclusion Leadership Forum** (Microsoft is a member)
- **Existing WA Government cloud agreements**

Quote from **Steven Worrall, Managing Director, Microsoft Australia**:
> "The addition of these new capabilities in Western Australia builds on Microsoft's strong history of delivering state-of-the-art technologies to the public and private sectors."

### 1.4 Current Azure Australia Infrastructure

**Existing Regions:**
- Australia East (Sydney) - Primary
- Australia Southeast (Melbourne) - DR/Secondary
- Australia Central (Canberra) - Government

**New Addition:**
- **Perth Azure Extended Zone (Mid-2025)** - Perfect timing for our production deployment
