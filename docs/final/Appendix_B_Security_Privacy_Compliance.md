## Summary

This comprehensive security, privacy, and compliance framework ensures:

1. **Defense-in-depth** security across all layers
2. **Strong cryptography** with HSM-backed key management
3. **Privacy by design** with data minimization and user control
4. **Full compliance** with Australian and international standards
5. **Robust incident response** with defined RTO/RPO targets
6. **Continuous monitoring** and improvement

The security architecture supports the $1,866,250 pilot budget with appropriate controls while providing a clear path to production-grade security.
