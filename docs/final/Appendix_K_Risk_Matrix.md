# Appendix K – Comprehensive Risk Matrix

[← Back to Master PRD](./PRD_Master.md#risk-management)

## Executive Summary

This risk matrix provides a comprehensive assessment of potential risks across technical, operational, financial, and compliance dimensions. Each risk is evaluated for likelihood, impact, and includes specific mitigation strategies with clear ownership.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

**Likelihood Scale:**
- **Low (1):** < 20% probability
- **Medium (2):** 20-50% probability  
- **High (3):** > 50% probability

**Impact Scale:**
- **Low (1):** Minor delays/costs, < $50K impact
- **Medium (2):** Moderate delays/costs, $50K-$200K impact
- **High (3):** Major delays/costs, > $200K impact

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**
- **1-2:** Low Risk (Monitor)
- **3-4:** Medium Risk (Active Management)
- **6-9:** High Risk (Priority Mitigation)
