- Explicit contingencies (15%)
- Transparent margin structure
- Conservative risk management

Action:
- Keep pilot price at $1,866,250
- Maintain 6.5 FTE team
- Add Claude's consumption model as Option 3
- Include volume discount tiers
```

### 2. Team Structure
**DECISION: Use ChatGPT's Structure**
```
Team Composition:
- Project Manager (1.0 FTE)
- Business Analyst (1.0 FTE) 
- Tester/QA (1.0 FTE)
- Solution Architect/Lead Dev (1.0 FTE)
- Full-Stack Developer (1.0 FTE)
- DevOps/Security Engineer (1.0 FTE)
- Support/Documentation (0.5 FTE)

Keep 15% contingency for super/leave/replacements
```

### 3. Technical Architecture
**DECISION: Merge Both Approaches**
```
Core Platform:
- Base: ChatGPT's Azure-specific implementation
- Pattern: Claude's microservices architecture
- Documentation: Claude's visual diagrams

Specific Choices:
- Azure Container Apps/AKS (ChatGPT)
- Event-driven patterns (Claude)
- PostgreSQL + Document store (hybrid)
- HSM with Azure Key Vault (merged)
```

### 4. Security Model
**DECISION: Merge with ChatGPT Base**
```
Foundation:
- ChatGPT's compliance framework
- Claude's advanced privacy features as differentiators
- Keep both approaches to encryption

Implementation:
- AES-256-GCM (standard)
- Homomorphic encryption (advanced option)
- Zero-knowledge proofs (future roadmap)
- Australian compliance focus (priority)
```

### 5. API and SDK Documentation
**DECISION: Use Claude's Approach**
```
Adopt:
- OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- Comprehensive SDK suite
- Multi-platform support
- Code examples in all languages
- Developer portal

Add:
- Australian-specific examples
- ServiceWA integration guides
```

### 6. Visual Documentation
**DECISION: Use Claude's Visuals**
```
Include all 15+ diagrams:
- System architecture
- Sequence flows
- State machines
- Data flows
- Deployment topology

Format:
- Mermaid diagrams (fixed syntax)
- Draw.io alternatives for complex diagrams
```

### 7. Risk Management
**DECISION: Use ChatGPT's Framework**
```
Keep:
- 38-risk comprehensive matrix
- Scoring methodology
- Mitigation strategies
- Regular review cadence

Add:
- Visual risk heat map (from Claude style)
```

### 8. Testing Strategy
**DECISION: Use Claude's Comprehensive Approach**
```
Adopt:
- 90% coverage target
- Property-based testing
- Chaos engineering
- Security fuzzing
- Performance regression

Keep ChatGPT's:
- Penetration testing schedule (1x pilot, 2x production)
```
