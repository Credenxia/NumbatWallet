## Pilot Phase Pricing

### ChatGPT Approach
- **Total Pilot Price**: $1,866,250 (12 months)
- **Team**: 6.5 FTE (explicitly AI-augmented)
  - PM, BA (1.0), Tester (1.0), Architect/Dev, Full-Stack Dev, DevOps/Security, Support (0.5)
- **Team Cost**: $1,092,500 (with 15% contingency)
- **Infrastructure**: $216,000 ($18K/month)
- **Margin**: 25%

### Claude Approach
- **Total Pilot Price**: ~$850,000 (estimated from consumption model)
- **Team**: 4-5 FTE 
- **Base Platform Fee**: $15,000/month
- **Consumption-based with included volumes**
- Shows both Option 1 (Consumption) and Option 2 (Fixed) more clearly

## Key Pricing Differences

| Component | ChatGPT | Claude | Gap Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pilot Total** | $1,866,250 | ~$850,000 | ChatGPT 2.2x higher |
| **Monthly Run Rate** | $155,520 | $70,833 | ChatGPT includes more overhead |
| **Team Size** | 6.5 FTE | 4-5 FTE | ChatGPT has dedicated BA + Tester |
| **Infrastructure** | $18,000/month | $15,000/month | Similar range |
| **Pricing Model** | Fixed with breakdown | Consumption + Fixed options | Claude more flexible |

## Production Pricing

### ChatGPT Production Model
**Option 1 - Infrastructure Plus Overheads (Fixed)**
- Small: $1,500,000/year (48% margin)
- Medium: $2,100,000/year (50% margin)
- Large: $2,800,000/year (35% margin)

**Option 2 - Consumption-Based**
- Small: $1.1M/year predicted
- Medium: $2.6M/year predicted
- Large: $4.3M/year predicted

### Claude Production Model
**Consumption-Based Structure**
- Base Platform: $15,000/month
- Active Wallets: $0.50/wallet/month
- Credentials: $0.10/credential
- Verifications: $0.01/verification
- Includes volume discounts up to 40%

## Critical Observations

### Strengths - ChatGPT
1. **Detailed Cost Breakdown**: Shows exactly where money goes
2. **Risk Mitigation**: 15% salary contingency, 10% project contingency
3. **Realistic Team Size**: Separate BA and Tester roles
4. **Infrastructure Transparency**: Detailed Azure cost breakdown
5. **Clear Margin**: Explicitly states 25% pilot, 48-50% production margins

### Strengths - Claude
1. **Flexible Pricing Options**: Clear consumption vs fixed models
2. **Volume Discounts**: Tiered pricing with up to 40% discounts
3. **Lower Entry Cost**: More attractive pilot pricing
4. **Visual Calculators**: Mermaid diagrams showing pricing calculations
5. **Granular Usage Pricing**: Per-wallet, per-credential, per-verification

## Assumptions Analysis

### ChatGPT Assumptions (Explicit)
- 15% contingency for super, leave, replacements
- AI productivity gains: 40-50%
- Penetration testing: 1× pilot, 2× production (recommendation)
- 3% annual CPI increases
- Infrastructure scaling with size

### Claude Assumptions (Implicit)
- Smaller team can deliver same output
- Lower overhead costs
- Consumption model scales naturally
- Infrastructure costs embedded in base fee

## Risk Assessment

**ChatGPT Approach**: Higher price but lower risk
- More conservative team sizing
- Built-in contingencies
- Explicit margin for sustainability

**Claude Approach**: Lower price but higher risk
- Lean team may struggle with scope
- No explicit contingency
- Margin not clearly stated

## Recommendation

**Use ChatGPT's pricing structure with adjustments:**
1. Keep the 6.5 FTE team structure (more realistic)
2. Maintain 15% contingency (critical for risk)
3. Consider offering Claude's consumption model as an option
4. Add Claude's volume discount tiers
5. Target middle ground: $1.5M pilot (between both proposals)

## Questions to Resolve
1. Is Claude's team size realistic for the scope?
2. Does Claude include contingency in base costs?
3. What drives the 2x price difference?
4. Which model better reflects market rates?
